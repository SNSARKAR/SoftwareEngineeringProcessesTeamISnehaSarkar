F9 : x^y
The function, f(y) = x^y is known as the exponential function, which is one of the examples of Transcendental functions( definition : A transcendental function can be defined as an analytic function that does not fulfill the expectations of a polynomial function i.e., it cannot be described in terms of a finite sequence of algebraic operationstion such as addition,multiplication,root extraction).

In general, an exponential function is a function in the form of f(y) = x^y, the variable x is the base and y is the exponent. In the above function, where the base ‘x’ is a positive constant and the exponent ‘y’ is a positive integer it means : x^y = x^1*x^2*x^3*... x^y.

If y = 0, then x^0=1,if y = -n where n is a positive integer then, x^y= x^-n=1/x^n.
The domain of the exponential function consists of all real numbers. The co-domain of the exponential function consists of all real numbers greater than zero. 

In all exponential functions of the form f (x) = b^x , where b > 0, have the following characteristics: 
• the f (x) at x-intercept is at 1
• there is a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 
The base, b, uniquely defines the overall shape of the graph. The function, f (y) increases more quickly because of the larger values  of base ‘b’. 
When b > 1, if f (x) increases as y increases, then the function displays 
exponential growth. 
When  0 <b < 1, if f (x) decreases as y increases, then the function displays exponential decay. By recognizing exponential growth or decay, we can get determine the general shape of an exponential function.
Note :
The restrictions on b are : • if b = 1, f (x) = 1, which is not exponential • if b = 0, f (x) = 0 for x > 0, and undefined for x ≤ 0 • if b < 0, f (x) is not defined, since it contains infinitely many vertical asymptotes between any two x values, when x = m/n for even n.
